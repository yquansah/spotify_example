FarApp Coding Challenge

Was not able to pull 1000 names from Spotify's API, but I added code to pull artists from the API, so that you can see I am using a public API with authentication.

Used Mongo Mlab for my database, so this is actually stored in the cloud. I used this database, because of its fast response time, and my familiarity of working with it. I wanted to use a NoSQL database because of its intuitivity, working under a tight 1 hour deadline.
